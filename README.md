# Tree Data-Structure
This repository contains my solutions for common Tree data structure problems and implementation of Data Structures in Cpp.
I've created this repository to learn about algorithms. I am adding solutions continuously.   

## Problems:

1. Add all greater values to every node in a BST
2. Binary Tree to BST
3. Binary Tree to DLL
4. Check for BST
5. Check for Balanced Tree
6. Children Sum property
7. Construct BST from Postorder
8. Convert Level Order Traversal to BST
9. Delete a node from BST
10. HEAPSORT
11. Inorder Successor in BST
12. Insert a node in a BST
13. Kth largest element in BST
14. Left View of Binary Tree
15. Level order traversal Line by Line
16. Lowest Common Ancestor in a BST
17. Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree
18. Maximum Width of Tree
19. Maximum no in Binary Tree
20. Median of BST
21. Predecessor and Successor
22. Print BST elements in given range
23. Print Common Nodes in BST
24. Print nodes at k distance from root
25. Search a node in BST 
26. Vertical Sum in a given Binary Tree
27. AVL-Insertion
28. AVL-Insertion-and-deletion
29. Binaryheap
30. Delete in binary search tree
31. k-th smallest element in BST
32. AVL tree left left rotation
33. Level order travesal
34. max and min in a tree
35. Right right rotation in AVl
36. Size of binary tree
37. Insert element in bst
